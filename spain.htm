    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p><b>Spain</b>, officially the Kingdom of Spain (Spanish: Reino de España), 
        is a country in southwestern Europe with some pockets of territory in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore in the Atlantic Ocean 
        and across the Strait of Gibraltar. Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula, and its 
        insular territory includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, several small islands in the Alboran Sea and the 
        Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The Spanish territory also includes the exclave of Llívia surrounded by the French 
        département of Pyrénées-Orientales and the African semi-exclaves of Ceuta, Melilla and Peñon de Vélez. The country's 
        mainland is bordered to the south by Gibraltar, to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north by France, 
        Andorra and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
    <p>With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second-largest country 
        in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth-largest country by area on the European continent. With a population 
        exceeding 47.4 million, Spain is the sixth-most populous country in Europe, and the fourth-most populous country in the European 
        Union. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, 
        Málaga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Bilbao.</p>
    <p>Anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 42,000 years ago. The first cultures and peoples 
        that developed in current Spanish territory were Pre-Roman peoples such as the ancient Iberians, Celts, Celtiberians, Vascones, 
        and Turdetani. Later, foreign Mediterranean peoples such as the Phoenicians and ancient Greeks developed coastal trading 
        colonies, and the Carthaginians briefly controlled part of the Spanish Mediterranean coastline. From the year 218 BCE, with 
        the taking of the city of Ampurias, the Roman colonization of Hispania began and, with the exception of the Atlantic cornice, 
        they quickly controlled the territory of present-day Spain. The Romans had driven the Carthaginians out of the Iberian peninsula 
        by 206 BCE, and divided it into two administrative provinces, Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior. The Romans 
        laid the foundations for modern Spanish culture and identity, and was the birthplace of important Roman emperors such as 
        Trajan, Hadrian or Theodosius I.</p>
