    <h1>Germany</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p><b>Germany</b>, officially the <b>Federal Republic of 
        Germany</b>, is a country in Central Europe. It is the second most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most 
        populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the 
        Alps to the south; it covers an area of 357,022 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi), with a population of over 83 million within 
        its 16 constituent states. It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland 
        to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and largest city is 
        Berlin, and its financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.</p>
    <p>Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania
         was documented before AD 100. In the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During 
         the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and 
         the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a 
         nation-state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the 
         German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the semi-presidential Weimar Republic.</p>
    <p>The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end 
        of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany, generally 
        known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, East Germany. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member 
        of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc 
        state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communism, German reunification saw the former East German states join 
        the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990—becoming a federal parliamentary republic.</p>
    <p>Germany is a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's fourth-largest economy by 
        nominal GDP, and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial, scientific and technological sectors, 
        it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. As a developed country, which ranks very high on the 
        Human Development Index, it offers social security and a universal health care system, environmental protections, and a 
        tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20, and the OECD. It has 
        the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
