    <h1>Azerbaijan</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p><b>Azerbaijan</b> (UK: /ˌæzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn, -ˈdʒæn/ (audio speaker iconlisten), US: /ˌɑːzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn, ˌæz-/; 
        Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan [ɑːzæɾbɑjˈdʒɑn]), officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country located at 
        the boundary of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is a part of the South Caucasus region, and is bounded 
        by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the west, 
        and Iran to the south. Baku is the capital and largest city.</p>
    <p>The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative 
        Republic in 1918 and became the first secular democratic Muslim-majority state, taking its name from the adjacent 
        region of northwestern Iran for political reasons. In 1922, the country was incorporated into the Soviet Union as 
        the Azerbaijan SSR.</p>
    <p>The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, shortly before the dissolution of the 
        Soviet Union in the same year. In September 1991, the ethnic Armenian majority of the Nagorno-Karabakh region formed 
        self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh. The region and seven surrounding districts are internationally recognized as 
        part of Azerbaijan, while negotiations on the resolution of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are facilitated by the OSCE. 
        Nagorno-Karabakh became de facto independent with the end of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. Following the 
        2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, the seven districts and parts of Nagorno-Karabakh were returned to Azerbaijani control.</p>
    <p>Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential republic. It is one of six independent Turkic states and an active member 
        of the Turkic Council and the TÜRKSOY community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 182 countries and holds 
        membership in 38 international organizations, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Non-Aligned 
        Movement, the OSCE, and the NATO PfP program. It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the CIS, and the OPCW. 
        Azerbaijan is also an observer state of the WTO.</p>
    <p>The vast majority of the country's population (97%) is Muslim, but the constitution does not declare an official 
        religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist. Azerbaijan is a developing country and ranks 
        88th on the Human Development Index. It has a high rate of economic development, literacy, and a low rate of 
        unemployment. The ruling party, the New Azerbaijan Party, in power since 1993, has been accused of authoritarian 
        leadership and the deterioration of the country's human rights record, including increasing restrictions on civil liberties, 
        particularly on press freedom and political repression.</p>
